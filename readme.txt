== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin come for free? =

Yes, it's completely free.

= Can I customize the appearance of each slide individually? =

Yes, each slide can be customized independently with different content, backgrounds, and styling options.

= Does GSlider Blocks work with any WordPress theme? =

Yes, GSlider Blocks is designed to work with any WordPress theme that supports the block editor.

= What is the difference between Base Slider and Flexi Content? =

Base Slider has pre-built content elements (title, subtitle, description, button) for quick setup. Flexi Content allows you to use any Gutenberg blocks inside slides for complete creative freedom.

= Why do my slides show overlapping content with Creative, Coverflow, or Flip effects? =

These are 3D transition effects where slides are stacked in layers. If your slides have transparent backgrounds, content from slides behind will show through. To fix this, add a background color or background image to each slide in your slider settings.
